# A "NORMAL" BUTTON

*Just your everyday, totally normal, absolutely not suspicious button. Nothing to see here, move along...*

## Basic Details

### Project Description
A completely normal button that definitely won't run away from your cursor, transform into a calculator, or have an existential crisis. It's just a button. Really. Trust us.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Buttons these days are too predictable. They just sit there, waiting to be clicked, doing exactly what they're told. Where's the excitement? Where's the mystery? Where's the borderline psychological warfare?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've created a button with personality disorders, trust issues, and a tendency to glitch into alternate dimensions. It's not just a button, it's an experience - one that your therapist will hear all about.

## Technical Details
### Technologies Used
- React (for giving buttons existential crises)
- CSS (for making buttons pretty before they break)
- JavaScript (for implementing chaos theory)
- Your Sanity (as a testing framework)

### Implementation
# Installation
```bash
# Clone this repository (if you dare)
git clone https://github.com/your-username/a-normal-button.git

# Enter the danger zone
cd a-normal-button

# Install dependencies (and questionable life choices)
npm install

# Start the chaos
npm start
```

# Usage Instructions
1. Click the button
2. Regret clicking the button
3. Try to click it again
4. Question reality
5. Repeat steps 1-4

### Features (or Symptoms)
- **Click Me Button**: A completely normal button that totally won't mess with your head
- **Calculator Mode**: Because sometimes buttons get tired of being just buttons
- **Glitch Effect**: Not a bug, definitely a feature
- **Dark Mode**: For when the button is feeling a bit moody
- **Event Log**: To keep track of all the perfectly normal things happening
- **Running Away**: Exercise is important, even for buttons

### Known "Features"
- Button may or may not listen to your clicks
- Calculator might appear when you least expect it
- Dark mode might be the button's decision, not yours
- Your cursor's self-esteem might take a hit

## Project States
1. **Normal State**: As rare as finding a unicorn
2. **Calculator Mode**: When math anxiety meets UI design
3. **Glitch State**: The button's way of saying "I'm having an existential crisis"
4. **Runaway Mode**: The button's cardio routine

## Disclaimer
No buttons were harmed in the making of this project. They're just a bit different.
